# Forecasting water-level fluctuation in water-supply dams of the Auckland and Waikato regions.

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks that were used for the paper ["Forecasting water-level fluctuation in water-supply dams of the Auckland and Waikato regions"](https://www.researchbank.ac.nz/handle/10652/5838).

The aim of the paper is to use statistical and machine learning (as well as deep learning) methods to analyse and predict water level fluctuations in 3 water supply dams in Auckland, New Zealand.
